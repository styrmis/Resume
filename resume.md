## Experience

### Horiba (Kyoto, Japan)

#### Software Developer

#### Autumn 2006

At Horiba I conducted research into how Linux could be used in future Horiba medical products. In doing so I experimented with building an embedded Linux distribution and cross-compile toolchain for running multi-lingual applications on ARM devices.

### Concept Systems Ltd. (Edinburgh, Scotland)

#### Software Developer

##### Autumn 2004-2005

In the first instance I worked for one year as an intern, and later returned for the summer after graduating. During this time I:

 * Produced and deployed a public-facing web service and site for EPSG geodetic data.
 * Maintained a multi-platform database migration tool (MS Access to MySQL, Postgres and Oracle).
 * Developed a customised version of TWiki to be used for the collaborative documenting of software products. This resulted in a small contribution back to the TWiki community.
 * Worked on both the backend and frontend of a web interface to a complex oil exploration system. Considerable time was spent on the optimisation of this interface to handle and display large amounts of production data.

##### Summer 2006

 * Effected a huge speedup in a database driven graphing application by optimising the database structure, in particular using sharding to dramatically reduce query execution times.
 * Refactored another graphing application to produce EPS instead of PNG output, improving the quality of the output and simultaneously solving several bugs related to plot placement.
 * Effected a considerable speedup in the custom TWiki instance used for internal documentation by isolating and removing an issue which caused the site to render extremely slowly.
