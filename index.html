<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am a current student of Computer Science at Cal Poly with an interest in
communication and design. I am a big believer in experimenting with new things
to expand my knowledge both professionally and recreationally. I strive to be a
quick learner and both a competent leader and capable worker. I am an Eagle
Scout and was an active officer of the Cal Poly Linux Users Group for three
years. I was awarded Cal Poly's Residence Hall Council member of the year for
both 2006 and 2007.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>

<p>Computer Science with Industrial Experience, BSc (2002-2006)

<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>Horiba (Kyoto, Japan)</h3>

<h4>Software Developer</h4>

<h4>Autumn 2006</h4>

<p>At Horiba I conducted research into how Linux could be used in future Horiba medical products. In doing so I experimented with building an embedded Linux distribution and cross-compile toolchain for running multi-lingual applications on ARM devices.</p>

<h3>Concept Systems Ltd. (Edinburgh, Scotland)</h3>

<h4>Software Developer</h4>

<h5>Autumn 2004-2005</h5>

<p>In the first instance I worked for one year as an intern, and later returned for the summer after graduating. During this time I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Produced and deployed a public-facing web service and site for EPSG geodetic data.</li>
<li>Maintained a multi-platform database migration tool (MS Access to MySQL, Postgres and Oracle).</li>
<li>Developed a customised version of TWiki to be used for the collaborative documenting of software products. This resulted in a small contribution back to the TWiki community.</li>
<li>Worked on both the backend and frontend of a web interface to a complex oil exploration system. Considerable time was spent on the optimisation of this interface to handle and display large amounts of production data.</li>
</ul>


<h5>Summer 2006</h5>

<ul>
<li>Effected a huge speedup in a database driven graphing application by optimising the database structure, in particular using sharding to dramatically reduce query execution times.</li>
<li>Refactored another graphing application to produce EPS instead of PNG output, improving the quality of the output and simultaneously solving several bugs related to plot placement.</li>
<li>Effected a considerable speedup in the custom TWiki instance used for internal documentation by isolating and removing an issue which caused the site to render extremely slowly.</li>
</ul>
